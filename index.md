Welcome to the website for Enigma - formerly the William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. Math Club!
<br/>
Here, you'll find contest registration, past lessons, and contact information for our presidents and staff supervisor.
<br/>
Our presidents are Jiayue Wu and Ruven Raizman. The president of math help is Lina Patrick.
<br/>
<br/>
Meetings are at lunch in room 227.
<br/>
Enigma math club: Mondays
<br/>
Boys math help: Tuesdays
<br/>
Girls math help: Thursdays
<br/>
Consider coming to Enigma!
We'll be doing crypto, puzzles, contest prep and interesting problems. 
<br/>
Tuesdays are boys math help, and Thursdays are girls math help. Show up to help or be helped, and I can't promise anything, but there *might* be pizza.
