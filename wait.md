# AMC 12 B Waitlist

Unlike other contests, we registered for the AMC early, giving us a limited number of slots.

I made a poor judgement call and believed that we would have approximately as many AMC 12 participants as last year. However, an unprecendented amount of people ended up signing up.

As a result, six people are on the waiting list. I take complete responsibility for this incident and I have given up my own AMC 12 B spot.

We will notify people as soon as possible if any spots open up. 

Thank you for your understanding,

Richard Yi
