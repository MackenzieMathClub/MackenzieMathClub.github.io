Welcome to the website for Enigma - formerly the William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. Math Club!
	
Here, you'll find contest registration, past lessons, and contact information for our presidents and staff supervisor.

Our presidents are Jiayue Wu and Ruven Raizman. The president of math help is Lina Patrick.

Meetings are at lunch in room 227.

  Enigma math club: Mondays

  Boys math help: Tuesdays

  Girls math help: Thursdays

Consider coming to Enigma!
We'll be doing crypto, puzzles, contest prep and interesting problems. 

Tuesdays are boys math help, and Thursdays are girls math help. Show up to help or be helped, and I can't promise anything, but there *might* be pizza.
